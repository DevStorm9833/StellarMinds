# Social Media Analysis Dashboard — Data-Driven Content Strategy Optimizer

# Overview

Creators and businesses rely on social media for visibility, but analyzing performance across multiple platforms is difficult. Users must manually track likes, comments, shares, reach, and follower behavior, leading to decisions based on assumptions instead of data.

# Common challenges include:
- Identifying which content type performs best (Reels, Carousels, Static posts)
- Understanding why some posts go viral while others don’t
- Finding the best posting time
- Tracking long-term engagement patterns across platforms
Existing tools offer limited analytics and lack a unified, intelligent dashboard.

# Expected Solution

Develop a web-based platform that consolidates social media analytics into one interface, visualizes performance metrics, detects patterns, and provides AI-powered insights. A natural-language query system should allow users to ask questions and get direct answers without technical skills.

# Deliverables
- Unified performance dashboard (likes, comments, shares, reach, engagement rate)
- Cross-format comparison system (Reels vs Carousels vs Static posts)
- AI natural-language query interface (e.g.,“Which post had the highest engagement last month?”)
- Automated insight summaries + strategic recommendations
- Exportable analysis reports for planning and decision-making
